# Job Finder
## Introduction
This website was created to defend the thesis regarding A/B testing. The main reason for this website is to provide job offers for students of AGH Univeristy of Science and Technology in Cracow (Poland), based on the field of study they attend. In this document I will describe only insigths regarding creating this site, not A/B testing.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Additionaly I created a script in Python that helped me find job offers from popular websites. I will upload my solution and leave a link for that script here later

GitHub Pages only serve static content, that is why it does not allow POST requests. That is the reason I had to ommit this method and the site with results appears in new window.

## Setup
You can access my website via GitHub Pages: https://anias98.github.io/strona-do-PL/page.html

## Features
You can search for job offers in Cracow that are suitable for every field of study of AGH UST. Those job offers are appropriate for students and graduates. I was looking for them from popular job boards, such as: 
* Pracuj.pl
* Praca.pl
* LinkedIn
* Indeed
* NoFluffJobs

## Status
Project is finished.
This website looks very plain, because my intentions was to present form in the easiest way possible.

## Inspiration
I had to prepare website to conduct A/B tests. I heard that on Universities in Germany during Job Fairs there are apps that tell you where you can find job opportunities, based on field of study you attend. I decided that I will prepare simmilar app for students and graduates of AGH UST.
